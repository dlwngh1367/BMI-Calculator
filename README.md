# BMI-Calculator


This app is an application that calculates the BMI by reflecting the BMI calculation formula(BMI = kg/m2).
If you enter your height and weight, you can calculate your BMI using the BMI formula.
To develop this app, I used UISlider to switch the screen, and I designed various classes and structures using inheritance.
And I created UI programmatically and used it by passing data to various functions.
I used Segue and Navigation to complete the Multi-Screen App.
I also applied MVC design patterns to this project in order to make it clear.
Finally, I processed the data through Nil Coalescing Operator, Optional Chaining, and Optional Binding.
